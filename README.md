## How to run
Pull the github repo (search online how to do it).
The weights and the images are in this Google Drive folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18ReQytYflPsRpvV3sF22POtDegb1_ejs?usp=sharing). Match the Google Drive folder names with the ones in the repo and put the images in accordingly.
